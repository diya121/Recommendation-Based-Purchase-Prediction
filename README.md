This project aims to predict whether an online shopper will make a purchase based on their browsing behavior. Using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from UCI, I preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardizing numerical variables. Feature selection techniques are applied to remove redundant attributes, improving model performance. 
I performed machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVC. The Random Forest model gained more accuracy (0.8925) than the other models.
