This project aims to predict whether an online shopper will make a purchase based on their browsing behavior. Using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from UCI, I preprocess the data by handling missing values and outliers, encoding categorical features, and standardizing numerical variables. The dataset was imbalanced, so I used SMOTE in order to make them balanced.
I performed machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVC. The Random Forest model gained more accuracy (0.9500) than the other models. Finally made a random sample data and trained using the random forest classifier model and predicted whether the customer will make a purchase or not.
